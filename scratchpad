Odds: 1/5 means for 1 dollar spent, if that bet wins, you get 5 dollars back
WD: winning dollars.  How much profit you'd expect to make from each dollar put in.
The Bookie will pay out to all the winners from the pot, and, if the pot empties out, from his own stash.  If in the negative, the Bookie can't create any more bets.  However, he can still bet up to 10% of the money he's indebted to, in order to try to win it back, even if he keeps going more in the negative.

Judges can't bet in their own categories.  Will have day after reveal date to make decision (PMed directly, only one judge needed).  Judges can delete bad bets (too subjective, etc) from their own categories.  Categories have their own flairs on the subreddit.  Leaderboards for total amount of money, biggest bets, etc.  Frequent posts on subreddit showing most popular bets.  

Possible categories:
TV shows (mr robot, got, rick and morty)
movies (star wars, marvel, etc)
books
politics (next president, impeachment, etc)
youtube series
celebrity news
miscellaneous
whatever you want, have fun.
Probably not sports, though.  Seem like they'd take over easily?  Maybe?

This involves no money, nor cyber currency or anything else of tangible value.  This is all pretend internet points.
